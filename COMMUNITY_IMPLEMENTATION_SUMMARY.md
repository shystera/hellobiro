# Community System Implementation for Kohza

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the community system for the Kohza learning platform. The community system allows students and coaches to engage in discussions within course contexts.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (`community-tables.sql`)
- **threads** table for course discussions
- **replies** table for responses to threads
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for access control
- Indexes for performance optimization

### 2. Backend API Endpoints (`server/index.js`)
Added the following endpoints:
- `GET /api/courses/:courseId/threads` - Get threads for a course
- `POST /api/threads` - Create a new thread
- `GET /api/threads/:threadId/replies` - Get replies for a thread
- `POST /api/replies` - Create a new reply

### 3. Frontend Client Functions (`supabase-client.js`)
Added community helper functions:
- `community.getThreads(courseId)` - Fetch threads for a course
- `community.createThread(threadData)` - Create a new thread
- `community.getReplies(threadId)` - Fetch replies for a thread
- `community.createReply(replyData)` - Create a new reply

### 4. Frontend Pages
Updated existing pages to use real data instead of placeholders:
- `community.html` - Course community overview
- `thread-detail.html` - Individual thread view with replies

## Features

### Thread Management
- Users can view all threads in their enrolled courses
- Users can create new discussion threads
- Threads are associated with specific courses
- Thread authors can be identified

### Reply System
- Users can reply to existing threads
- Replies are displayed in chronological order
- Reply counts are shown for each thread

### Access Control
- Only enrolled students and course coaches can view threads
- Only authenticated users can create threads and replies
- Users can only edit/delete their own content

### User Experience
- Relative time formatting (e.g., "2 hours ago")
- User avatars and names displayed
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Loading states during API operations

## Security
- Row Level Security policies ensure data isolation
- Authentication required for all operations
- Input validation on backend endpoints
- Proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

## How to Deploy

1. Run the SQL in `community-tables.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor
2. Restart your backend server to expose the new API endpoints
3. The frontend pages will automatically use the new functionality

## Future Enhancements
- Thread categorization/tags
- User mentions and notifications
- Thread following/subscriptions
- Rich text formatting for posts
- File attachments
- Thread search functionality
- Moderation tools for coaches
